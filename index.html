        <div class="box js-scroll slide-right"> <strong> Node-Link diagram</strong><br />
            The most straight-forward way to visualise a dataset of emails is through the use of a node-link diagram.
            Here we draw dots to represent the correspondants and then we draw arrows between them to represent an email sent.
            The dots have a color which represents the job-title of the correspondant and the edges are colored according to their sentiment.
            This allows one to find patterns in the data using one's intuition.
            One may find, for instance, a notably isolated group of correspondants, or maybe an unusually negative batch of emails coming from the CEO.
        </div>
        <div class="box js-scroll slide-left"> <strong> Adjacency Matrix</strong><br />
            <p>Our adjacency matrix is usefull in cases where the amount of emails is very large compared to the amount of correspondants.
                This is a table where every row represents all of the emails sent by some person and every column represents the emails recieved by some person.
                So a cell represents a batch of emails sent from the person represented by its row to some person represented by its column.
                The cell will appear darker the more emails where sent between these people.
                Cells may also have some color, indicating its total sentiment or the job titles of the people involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                We allow the user to choose the way in which the rows and columns are ordered. 
                This allows one to find larger patterns in the data.
                For example one may change the ordering so that correspondants of the same job title are clustered together.
                This would then allow one to easily observe whether correspondants of some job title disproportionatly sent emails to people of some other job title for example.

        <div class="box js-scroll slide-right"><strong>Interaction techniques</strong> <br />
            Because datasets may be very large we allow the user to interact with the data in various ways.
            Users can choose a timeframe to which the displayed emails are restricted for example.
            The user can also decide to display only the emails that adhere to some specified criterion.
            To specify such a criterion, users may write arbitrary javascript or pick from a list of presets.
            Lastly, users may find an iteresting set of emails in one visualisation which they may then want to locate in the other visualisation.
            For this reason we allow users to select emails in one visualisation using the mouse, which will then highlight the same set of emails in the other visualisation.
